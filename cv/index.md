In 2012 I joined [Wooga](https://wooga.com) to help make millions of players enjoy wonderful games on their mobile devices. At Wooga I worked on bringing to life the mobile version of [Pearl's Peril](http://www.wooga.com/games/pearlsperil/).

### Pearl's Peril

From the bottom of the Pacific to the top of the Eiffel Tower, revisit the golden age of exploration and get swept away on a truly thrilling adventure.

#### My role on Peal's Peril
Working in a mixed competence team of about 30 people, I developed the [iOS version](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/pearls-peril/id594802437?mt=8) of Pearl’s Peril, an hidden object game with episodic content.   

On a everyday basis I collaborated with other front-end and back-end engineers to deliver the best technical quality and user experience for social games on the iOS platform. 

My responsibilities:

* Develop a flexible and robust game architecture to allow for integration of future features
* Giving technical feedback to game designers and product owners
* Integrate the work of game artists into the game.

Adopting an agile work flow, I worked on a number of different features of the game. I have implemented parts of the core game loop, including the city builder mechanics and hidden object scenes, as well as the network engine, the Downloadable Content (DLC) subsystem, the sound engine, and various parts of the user interface. 

The content intensive project has posed several challenges on the technical side originating both from targeting multiple resolution devices as well as keeping the DLC and app bundle size to the minimum.


Technologies & Processes:

## Freelance

### Tweek.tv
[Tweek](http://www.tweek.tv) is about connecting people to video. Tweek was designed as a new entry door to future video consumption: One Personalised Video Discovery across hundreds of Apps + Websites to serve everybody with nothing less than the personally & contextually most relevant content.

Tweek aims to solve two major consumer problems we all know when leaning back on the couch in the evening to watch video: What’s worth my time? Where can I get it now?

I helped Tweek getting their up in shape for iOS 7 and again for iOS 8

Durated promotes positive change in retail by revealing the bigger picture.
