[Danger](http://danger.systems/ruby/) is a [ruby gem](https://github.com/danger/danger)
that you can use on your continuous integration process to automate code reviews.

Danger can automatically go through the code in a an open pull request
and check if it respects the rules your team and you have established.

When used in combinations with certain source code management platforms, Danger
can even comment directly on an open pull request.

Danger can:

- Run on: Circle, Travis, Jenkins, Buildkite, BuddyBuild, Semaphore, TeamCity, Xcode Bots, Drone, Surf and Bitrise.
- Chat back on: GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.
- Handle diffs from: Git.

Off the top of your head, what is a good tool to enforce code style and other
criteria in a Haskell code base?

You guessed it, [hlint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint). Introducing [danger-hlint](https://github.com/blender/danger-hlint).

Here is an example of Danger controlling [hlintBot and commenting on a pull request](https://github.com/blender/Rome/pull/83).

# danger-hlint

[danger-hlint](https://github.com/blender/danger-hlint) is plugin for Danger and ruby gem. The core of `danger-hlint` is the [lint](https://github.com/blender/danger-hlint/blob/master/lib/hlint/plugin.rb#L31)
function that calls `hlint` with a set of parameters.

Let's see how to use it.

## Setting up Danger

Setting up Danger for your project is very easy. Here is a [complete guide](http://danger.systems/guides/getting_started.html), but for the impatience
it boils down to installing [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) and doing:

```
$ cd myProject
$ bundle init
$ echo "gem 'danger'" >> Gemfile
$ echo "gem 'danger-hlint'" >> Gemfile
$ bundle install
```

Now you should have two new files on disk, `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`. __Add these to version control__ and commit.

At this point you can run either run `bundle exec danger init` and follow the
instructions on screen or continue reading this blog post.

What `bundle exec danger init` does is:
- creates a `Dangerfile` — We will [create one manually](#dangerfile)
- prompts you to set up a Github account for Danger to comment our your PRs with — We won't need this as we will be using [hlintBot](https://github.com/hlintBot)
- instructs you on how to set up a CI — We will see [how to set up Travis](#travis)

I will guide you through a quick set up using [GitHub](https://github.com/) and
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). Reading this guide will probably take you
longer than setting things up as it is very easy.

Refer to the [complete guide](http://danger.systems/guides/getting_started.html) for different set ups or if you get into trouble.


## Dangerfile

The Dangerfile is where you specify the rules to apply to the code, and that is
where we'll use `danger-hlint`. The Dangerfile is a ruby script that we will write using function from `danger-hlint` and the `danger` gem itself.

Create a file called `Dangerfile` in the root of your project and paste in the
following

```ruby
# get all affected files by the changes in the current diff
affected_files = git.added_files + git.modified_files

# limit files to .hs files
haskell_files = affected_files.select { |file| file.end_with?('.hs') }

# run hlint on the files and comment inline in the PR
hlint.lint haskell_files inline_mode: true
```

If you wish to pass more arguments to hlint just add them as keyword arguments
like so

```ruby
# run hlint on the files with my special hint file and comment inline in the PR
hlint.lint haskell_files inline_mode: true hint: "/path/to/MyHlinHintfile.yaml"
```

All arguments should be passed on transparently to hlint, if they are not feel
free to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/blender/danger-hlint/pulls)
to fix that.

At this point you can already run Danger locally by following [these instructions](http://danger.systems/guides/troubleshooting.html#i-want-to-work-locally-on-my-dangerfile).

## Travis  

Now that you have Danger set up locally, the next step is to run
it on your CI. I will explain here how to set up Travis to run Danger specifically
for Haskell projects. You can find a complete `.travis.yaml` [here](https://github.com/blender/Rome/blob/0e18fc82f2bfa27b49f6e31539d6bce376cb0928/.travis.yml) and at the end of this
section.

The setup process is comprised of two parts:
- [Adding commands to your existing `.travis.yaml`](#tavis.yaml)
- [Enabling Danger to comment on pull requests](#enabling-danger-to-comment-on-pull-requests)

### travis.yaml

First off before the install step on Travis, we have to set up the `ruby`.

This is done by using [RVM](https://rvm.io/) which is available on Travis' image
for `C` projects. Add to your `.travis.yaml` file a `before_install` the following

```yaml
before_install:
# Update ruby
- rvm use 2.1 --install --binary --fuzzy
```

Next we need to download hlint.

Here is a rake task to do so. You don't have to
use a rake task, any other way will do as well. Feel free to use your own script
to download and install hlint.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/blender/318d773a127da64300443ef149fa1229.js"></script>

Save this as `Rakefile` at top level in your project. __Add this file to version
control__ and commit it.

Now, back in then `.travis.yaml` file in the
`before_install` step, we run `rake hlint:install[2.0.9]` task to install hlint at version `2.0.9`.

```yaml
before_install:
# Update ruby
- rvm use 2.1 --install --binary --fuzzy
# Download and instal hlint
- rake hlint:install[2.0.9]
```

Next in the the `install` step we want to install `Danger` and `danger-hlint` on
Travis.

We specified these gems as dependencies earlier in the `Gemfile` and
`Gemfile.lock` and __committed those to files on in our project's repository__.
We can just then run `bundle install --deployment`. We want to use the `--deployment`
flag so that we can cache the `vendor/bundle` directory where bundler is going
to install the dependencies.

```yaml
install:
  # Run bundler and install the dependencies in vendor/bundle
  # so that it can be cached.
  - bundle install --deployment
```

Next in the `script` step we want to run Danger so we simply add `bundle exec danger`

```yaml
script:
  - bundle exec danger
```

Last we're going to tell Travis to cache the `vendor/bundle` directory so that on
the next run `bundle install --deployment` will potentially do no work.

```yaml
# Caching so the next build will be fast too.
cache:
  directories:
  - vendor/bundle
```

[Here is an example](https://github.com/blender/Rome/blob/0e18fc82f2bfa27b49f6e31539d6bce376cb0928/.travis.yml) of how a final and complete `.travis.yaml` file looks like for
Haskell projects, including Danger setup.

In the next section we will see how to allow Danger to comment on the pull requests
that will be open on our project from now on.

### Enabling Danger to comment on pull requests

Danger is able to comment on pull request on GitHub by controlling an account via
a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Rather than using
your own account you can create another account on GitHub using the incognito mode on
you web browser as suggested on [Danger.systems](http://danger.systems/guides/getting_started.html#setting-up-an-access-token).

Alternatively I have already created [@hlintBot](https://github.com/hlintBot). Feel
free to use this account in the next steps, the access token to control [@hlintBot](https://github.com/hlintBot) is

<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/qHi3REdK"></script>

Once you have an access token, open your project's Travis control panel at
[travis-ci.org/{you}/{project}/settings](https://travis-ci.org/{you}/{project}/settings).

In the __Environment Variables__ section add an environment variable called
`DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` and assign it the value of your access token. Refer to
the [CI/Token Setup section on Danger.Systems](http://danger.systems/guides/getting_started.html#continuous-integration) if these instructions are unclear.

At this point your are all set and Danger should be able to comment on you open
pull requests. Here is an example of [hlintBot commenting on a pull request](https://github.com/blender/Rome/pull/83).


## Conclusions - TL;DR

We have seen how to set up a system to automatically comment on pull requests
to encourage contributors to follow your hlint rules.

Recapping, to run `danger-hlint` you need:
- At top level in your project
  - A `Gemfile` & `Gemfile.lock` requiring `danger` and `danger-hlint`
  - A `Dangerfile` where you call `hlint.lint`
  - A `.travis.yaml` where you download `hlint` and run `bundle exec danger`
- On travis-ci.org
  - Add a `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable containing a GitHub access
  token

Happy Haskelling with Danger & hlint.
